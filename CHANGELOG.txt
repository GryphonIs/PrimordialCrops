 *
 * V1.6c Changelog
 * ---------------
 *
 * Added Config file support. (3000% more painfull than i first thought)
 *
 * NOTE: recipes for disabled crops are not registered, ANY recipe that relies
 *       on a crops essence will become unavailable (one exception detailed below).
 *
 * NOTE 2: Some recipes have alternate's, if certain essences are not available,
 *         they are replaced with vanilla items, this is off by default, enable
 *         it from config.
 *             (Use this with caution as it can break mod progression!!!)
 *
 * Due to the fact every crop is now togglable,some hard coded safeguards have been put
 * in place to preserve mod progression. e.g. if none of the essences are available for
 * for crafting a certain tier infusion stone, an alternate recipe using a vanilla item
 * is used instead. (i dont want people complaining the mod is broken because somebody
 * changed the config and didnt check if it messed things up!)
 *
 * i have tested the config options to the best of my ability with the time i have,
 * but the different combinatons are huge in number. if you dont see a recipe, there is
 * a good chance a disabled crop/essence was used in its crafting.
 *
 * The new config options are:-
 *
 * - You can now disable any crop you choose.
 * - Special crops now have a Hard and Easy recipe (togglable, default to hard recipes)
 * - Weapons can now be disabled (on by default)
 * - Minico seed drops from breaking grass is toggable (on by default)
 * - % Chance of extra seed on harvest of regular crop can now be 0% - 100% (default 20%)
 * - % Chance of extra seed on harvest of special crop can now be 0% - 100% (default 3%)
 * - Harvest On Right click ( toggable, off by default, ignored if Pam's HarvestCraft installed)
 * - Infusion stones can now have durability ( off by deafult )
 * - Max uses of Infusion stone with durability can be changed (0 - 1000 uses, 100 be default)
 *
